<h1>Local Storage and Session Storage Demonstration</h1>

<p class="information">
    The session storage is restricted to ONLY the session itself. That means that as soon as the user closes the tab or
    opens the website in a new tab, the session changes. Hence, the session ID changes too.

<p class="information">
    The local storage differs a lot from session storage. While the session storage expires as soon as the user closes
    the current session or tab, the local storage - NEVER EXPIRES.
    Hence, the value of the local storage will stay the same even when the tab is duplicated.
