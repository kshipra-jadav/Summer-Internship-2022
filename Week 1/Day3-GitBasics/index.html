					Introduction to CSS
				</div>
				<p class="text">
					Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
					
					while html uses tags, css uses rulesets.
					CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

					Why Use CSS?
				</div>
				<p class="text">
					CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
					<br>
					Easy Maintenance: To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
					<br>
					Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
					<br>
					Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
					<br>
					Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.

					Structure Of A CSS Ruleset
				</div>
				<p class="text">
					
					The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:
					<br><br>
					Selector :-
					<br>
					This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, < p > elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
					<br><br>
					Declaration :-
					<br>
					This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.
					<br><br>
					Properties :-
					<br>
					These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the < p > elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
					
					Property value
					To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
